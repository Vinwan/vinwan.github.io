        <title>憨人</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;从搭建这个博客开始，我就在想第一篇 blog 该以什么样的内容开头，需要表达些什么。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就像标题所说的，我从来都不是一个聪明的人。从来都没有任何方面的天份，从来没有过。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但是我很幸运，一直都有一个充满着正能量的偶像，一直都有这么一首歌陪着我，在没有人看得到我的时候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作为「憨人」或许就更应该去坚持，坚持地去做好每一件事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;我的心内感觉 人生的沉重

不敢来振动

我不是好子 也不是歹人

我只是爱眠梦

我不愿随浪随风 飘浪西东

亲像船无港

我不愿做人 奸巧钻缝

甘愿来作憨人

我不是头脑空空 我不是一只米虫

人啊人 一世人

要安怎欢喜 过春夏秋冬

我有我的路 有我的梦

梦中的那个世界

甘讲伊是一场空

我走过的路 只有希望

希望你我讲过的话

放在心肝内 总有一天

看到满天全金条 要煞无半顶

环境来戏弄

背景无够强 天才无够弄

我逐项是拢输人

只好看破这虚华

不怕路歹行 不怕大雨淋

心上一字敢 面对我的梦

甘愿来作憨人

我不是头脑空空 我不是一只米虫

人啊人 一世人

要安怎欢喜 过春夏秋冬

我有我的路 有我的梦

梦中的那个世界

甘讲伊是一场空

我走过的路 只有希望

希望你我讲过的话

放在心肝内 总有一天

我知道总会有一天
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;套用「至匠心」中的一句话，专注的做点东西至少对得起光阴岁月，其他的就交给时间去说吧。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/img/post-sample-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
